# 🤖 LLM Zoomcamp Course — Homework Submissions

Welcome! This repository contains my weekly homework submissions for the (**LLM Zoomcamp: A Free Course on Real-Life Applications of LLMs**)[https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/tree/main] course.

Over 10 weeks, I'll be developing AI applications that can answer questions over a custom knowledge base using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and supporting technologies like **vector search**, **evaluation**, **monitoring**, and more.
